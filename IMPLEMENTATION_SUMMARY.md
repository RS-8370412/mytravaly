### 5. Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  http: ^1.2.0

- ✅ Multi-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 7. UI/UX Features

- Modern Material 3 design
- Responsive layouts
- Loading indicators
- Error messages with icons
- Empty states
- Smooth navigation transitions
- Status bar styling
- Card-based layouts

### 8. Assets

- Proper asset declaration in `pubspec.yaml`

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. Firebase authentication setup and implementation
2. All UI pages created and styled
3. API integration structure
4. Hotel model with complete data parsing
5. Search results display with beautiful cards
6. Error handling throughout
7. Logout functionality
8. Visitor token management infrastructure

### ⚠️ Pending/TODO
1. **Device Registration API**: The visitor token endpoint is not documented in the provided API docs
   - The system is ready to store and use visitor tokens
   - Currently, requests are made without visitor token
   - API may accept requests with only authtoken

2. **Testing**: Manual testing needed to verify:
   - API response without visitor token
   - Full user flow
   - Firebase authentication on all platforms
   - Error scenarios

## Known Limitations

1. **Visitor Token**: The API documentation mentions a Device Registration API to obtain the visitor token, but the exact endpoint and parameters are not provided in the documentation link shared.
2. **Static Search Parameters**: Currently using hardcoded dates and search criteria. Could be made dynamic based on user input.
3. **Booking Functionality**: Book Now button currently shows a snackbar. Actual booking flow not implemented.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
